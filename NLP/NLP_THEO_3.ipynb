        "The basic architecture of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) cell consists of a single node that receives input from both the current time step and the previous hidden state. The node then computes the current hidden state using an activation function, such as a tanh or ReLU, based on the input and previous hidden state. This hidden state is then passed to the next time step as input, allowing the RNN to model dependencies between time steps. The output of the RNN is usually generated from the hidden state of the final time step, and is used for tasks such as classification or prediction."

It works by unfolding the RNN over time, turning it into a feedforward network, and then using the standard backpropagation algorithm to calculate the gradients of the network parameters with respect to the loss. The gradients are then used to update the parameters using an optimization algorithm, such as gradient descent. BPTT can be computationally expensive, as it requires calculating the gradients over all time steps, but it is a powerful tool for training RNNs on sequential data."

        "Vanishing and exploding gradients are problems that can occur when training deep neural networks using backpropagation. The vanishing gradient problem occurs when the gradients become very small, making it difficult for the optimization algorithm to update the parameters effectively. This can make it difficult to train deep networks, as the gradients may simply disappear and not provide enough information to update the parameters. The exploding gradient problem occurs when the gradients become very large, making it difficult for the optimization algorithm to choose appropriate step sizes. This can cause the optimization algorithm to oscillate and not converge, or to converge to a suboptimal solution. Both vanishing and exploding gradients can be addressed using techniques such as weight initialization, normalization, or using more advanced optimization algorithms.\n",

LSTMs use gating mechanisms to allow the hidden state to selectively forget or retain information from previous time steps, making them better suited to modeling long-term dependencies in sequential data. An LSTM cell consists of several components, including an input gate, a forget gate, an output gate, and a memory cell, that are used to control the flow of information into and out of the cell.
