        "The float class represents a floating-point number in Python, which is a data type that is used to store approximate decimal values. The main benefit of the float class is that it is fast and efficient, and can represent a wide range of values with good precision. However, the float class has some drawbacks as well. One disadvantage is that it is not suitable for storing exact decimal values, because the internal representation of a floating-point number is not exact. This can cause rounding errors and loss of precision when working with decimal values.\n",
        "The Decimal class, on the other hand, is specifically designed for storing exact decimal values. The Decimal class provides a high degree of precision and allows you to store and manipulate decimal values with a high degree of accuracy. The main disadvantage of the Decimal class is that it is slower and more memory-intensive than the float class, because it stores decimal values as integer values internally."
