        "Handling errors: One common use of exception processing is to handle errors that may occur during the execution of a program. For example, if a program attempts to divide by zero or tries to access a file that does not exist, an exception will be raised and the exception handling code can be used to gracefully handle the error and recover from it, if possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "Validation: Exception processing can also be used to validate user input or other data to ensure that it is in the correct format or meets certain criteria. For example, a program may use exception handling to check that a user has entered a valid email address or phone number.\n",
        "\n",
        "Debugging: Exception processing can be a useful tool for debugging a program. By raising exceptions when certain conditions are met, a programmer can more easily identify and fix errors in their code. Exception handling can also be used to log information about the error, which can be helpful in tracking down the root cause of the problem."

They can also be a security risk, as an unhandled exception could potentially expose sensitive information or allow an attacker to exploit a vulnerability in the program. Therefore, it is important to properly handle exceptions in your code to ensure that the program behaves as expected and is as secure as possible."

        "Fall back to an alternative solution: If it is not possible to recover from the exception, you may need to fall back to an alternative solution. For example, if a file cannot be opened, you could try reading from a different file or asking the user to provide a new file."
