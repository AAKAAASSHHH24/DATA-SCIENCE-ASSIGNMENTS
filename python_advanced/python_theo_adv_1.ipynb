        "*The purpose of Python's object-oriented programming (OOP) features is to enable users to define their own objects that behave like built-in objects in Python, but can also have custom methods and attributes. This allows for more modular and reusable code, as well as a higher level of abstraction. In Python, OOP is implemented using classes, which allow users to define the attributes and methods that belong to a particular object type. Classes can also be organized into an inheritance hierarchy, allowing for inheritance of attributes and methods from parent classes to child classes. OOP allows for the creation of complex programs by dividing them into smaller, modular pieces that can be more easily understood and maintained.*"
