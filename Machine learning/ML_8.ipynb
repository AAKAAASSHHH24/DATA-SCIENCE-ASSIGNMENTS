For example, if a variable \"color\" has values \"red\", \"green\", and \"blue\", three new binary variables \"color_red\", \"color_green\", and \"color_blue\" would be created. Each observation would have a value of 1 in the variable that corresponds to its color and 0 in the other two variables. One-hot encoding can be useful for models that assume independence between the features such as logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis.\n",
