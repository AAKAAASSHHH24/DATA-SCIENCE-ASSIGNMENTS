It serves to discourage the agent from taking actions that are not in its best interest. A reward, on the other hand, is a positive outcome that is given to the agent for taking an action that leads to a desirable state. The goal of the agent in reinforcement learning is to maximize the total reward it receives over time."

In this case, the high-level language serves as an abstraction of the underlying system, allowing the programmer to represent the system in a more simplified and manageable form."

The concept of generalization plays a critical role in the machine learning process, as the ultimate goal of training a machine learning model is to produce a model that can generalize well to new, unseen data. If a model is not able to generalize well, it will perform poorly on new data, which is not what we want.\n",
