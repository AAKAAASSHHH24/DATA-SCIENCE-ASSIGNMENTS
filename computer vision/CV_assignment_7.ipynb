        "Covariate shift is a phenomenon that occurs when the distribution of the input features changes between the training and the test phases of a machine learning model. This can occur if the training data and test data come from different distributions, or if the input distribution changes over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Covariate shift can have a negative impact on the performance of a machine learning model. If the model is trained on a distribution that is different from the test distribution, the model's predictions may be less accurate, and it may be more prone to overfitting. This can be particularly problematic in situations where the test data distribution is not well understood, or where the distribution may change over time.\n",

It is also important to be mindful of the potential for covariate shift when collecting and preparing training data, and to ensure that the training data is representative of the distribution of the test data."
