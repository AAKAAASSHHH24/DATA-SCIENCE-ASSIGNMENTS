        "In standard momentum optimization, the update to the weights at each time step is based on both the current gradient of the loss function and the past gradients, with a momentum term controlling the contribution of the past gradients. This can help to smooth the optimization process and reduce the oscillations that can occur when using standard gradient descent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cyclical momentum extends the standard momentum algorithm by introducing a cyclical schedule for the momentum term, rather than using a fixed value. The momentum term is incremented from a lower value to a higher value over a certain number of iterations, and then decremented back to the lower value over the same number of iterations. This process is repeated for the duration of training.\n",
