Region proposals are used to generate a set of candidate regions in an image that may contain an object of interest. These candidate regions are then passed through a classifier to determine whether they contain the object or not.\n",

This allows object detection algorithms to be more efficient, as they only need to process a small number of candidate regions rather than examining the entire image. There are various techniques for generating region proposals, including sliding window, selective search, and proposal networks."
