The filters are applied using a process called convolution, which involves sliding the filter over the input data and computing the dot product between the entries of the filter and the input data at each position. This produces a set of \"feature maps\" which highlight the presence of the features detected by the filters in the input data.\n",

        "Simplifying the model: A simpler model is often easier to interpret and understand, and may be less prone to overfitting. By refactoring the network to remove unnecessary layers or reduce the number of parameters, it is possible to simplify the model while still maintaining good performance.\n",

        "Reducing training time: Refactoring the network to make it more efficient can reduce the amount of time and computational resources required to train the model. This can be achieved by using techniques such as weight sharing or distillation to reduce the number of parameters in the network.\n",

        "Improving interpretability: Refactoring the network to make it more interpretable can make it easier to understand how the model is making its predictions and to identify any biases or errors in the model.
